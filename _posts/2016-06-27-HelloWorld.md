#Who am I?

Hello, World! My name is Richard Knoche.  I'm a graduate student working on my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Maryland.  My research focuses on advancing signal corrections and calibration techniques for the the world's most sensitive dark matter detector, [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/).  While I enjoy the deep understanding of nature and the challenging experiences that a career in physics brings, I've also found a passion for using data analysis to contribute to the decision making process of our large collaboration.  To align my career with this passion, I hope to transition into the field of data science after I finish my Ph.D. at the end of 2016.

#What is a data scientist?

The term "data science" casts a wide net over a deep pool of specialties.  At the shallowest level, data scientists uses math, computer science, and intuition to extract meaningful insights into large amounts of messy data.  If you dive a little deeper you'll find that this job description can mean different things to different companies.  At times, a data scientist is a glorified data analyst -- interacting with MySQL databases and producing basic data visualizations in an effort to make the data more accessible and meaningful to their company.  Other times, a data scientist can take on more of a data engineering role.  In this case, they will be responsible for developing the company's data infastructure and building pipelines of filtered information.  A data scientist can also be the person interacting with that filtered information; performing complex statistical and machine learning analyses to create actionable insights and data-driven products.

#How is data science related to physics?

The resonsiblities of a data scientist bear an uncanny resemblance to my every day work as a physics graduate student.  My largest contribution to [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/) was the construction of a signal corrections module.  This required me to clean up terabytes of calibration data on a remote server and apply various modeling techniques to automatically extract over 300 relevant quantities from each data set.  After extracting these quantities, I collected them in a MySQL database and produced streamlined scripts that helped collaboration members access the information on demand.  I also used the MySQL database to produce data visualizations that monitored the stability of our detector and informed day-to-day operations.  Many of my other responsibilities involved applying advanced statistical techniques such as linear regression, reduced &#120768;<sup>2</sup> fitting, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods, and maximum likelihood fitting to measure fundamental detector parameters such as our signal gains and energy scale calibration.  Throughout this process I used a combination of the python, matlab, and c++ programming langauges, which are all popular among data scientists.

In addition to the aforementioned technqiues, my time as a physics graduate student has taught me how to present complicated results to a wide variety of audiences.  I've written  technical, peer-reviewed papers for experts in the field, presented high-level overviews of [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/) to physicists outside of dark matter research, and produced simple and digestable talks for the general public.  

If data science is so similar to physics, you might wonder why I want to change careers at all.  The truth is, I'd be happy staying in physics.  The challenging analysis and interpretation of data is exactly what I'm looking for in a career.  However, as a physics career progresses more and more of your time is taken away from data analysis tasks and instead spent writing grants and papers, and teaching physics classes.  Transitioning to a career in data science would allow me to maintain a focus on data analysis.  Below, I've included a graphic from [Alex Smolyanskaya](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/09/22/quantifying-my-transition-from-academia-to-data-science/) that illustrates the different amount of time spent on analysis tasks as a post-doc researcher and a data scientist.  I must admit, I'll miss the large amount of time that is dedicated to experiments during a post-doc position!
