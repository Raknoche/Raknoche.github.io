My name is Richard Knoche.  I recently finished my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Maryland, where I was advancing signal corrections and calibration techniques for the the world's most sensitive dark matter detector, [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/).  While I enjoyed the deep understanding of nature and the challenging experiences that a career in physics brings, I also found a passion for using data analysis to contribute to the decision making process of our large collaboration.  To align my career with this passion, I'm transitioning to a career in the data science industry.

If you would like more information about me or my graduate school research, please read my [Hello, World](http://www.dealingdata.net/2016/07/08/HelloWorld/) blog post.  I've also provided the following link in the sidebar of my web page:
