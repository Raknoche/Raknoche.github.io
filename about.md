My name is Richard Knoche.  I'm a graduate student working on my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Maryland.  My research focuses on advancing signal corrections and calibration techniques for the the world's most sensitive dark matter detector, [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/).  While I enjoy the deep understanding of nature and the challenging experiences that a career in physics brings, I've also found a passion for using data analysis to contribute to the decision making process of our large collaboration.  To align my career with this passion, I hope to transition into the field of data science after I finish my Ph.D. at the end of 2016. 

If you would like more information about me or my graduate school research, please read my [Hello, World](http://www.dealingdata.net/2016/07/08/HelloWorld/) blog post.  I've also provided the following link in the sidebar of my web page:
